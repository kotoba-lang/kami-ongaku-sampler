  "Real-browser E2E proof for kami-ongaku-sampler: proves the repo's real,
   unit-tested trigger/lookup logic (kami.ongaku.sampler/trigger-sample --
   key/velocity-layer zone lookup with exact boundary handling, deterministic
   round-robin cycling, streaming-lifecycle state machine) correctly drives
   real audio output once combined with kotoba-lang/audio's real
   oscillator + ADSR DSP via kotoba-lang/org-w3-webaudio's proven
   AudioWorkletProcessor path (org-w3-webaudio commit e554d853d640).

   kami-ongaku-sampler has no sample-file decoding of its own (out of scope
   per its own README) -- test/e2e/src/kami/ongaku/e2e/fixture.cljc
   substitutes a distinct real oscillator frequency for each sample-ref
   (see that namespace's docstring for the exact zone/velocity-layer/
   round-robin/pitch-offset/gain fixture, which reuses this repo's OWN
   sampler_test.cljc boundary values rather than inventing new ones).

   For each of a sequence of (note, velocity, trigger-count) inputs, this
   compiles+runs (via test/e2e/src/kami/ongaku/e2e/{worklet_dsp,main_driver}.cljs,
   scripts/build-e2e-bundles.sh):
     1. kami.ongaku.e2e.fixture/resolve-trigger (-> kami.ongaku.sampler's
        REAL trigger-sample) inside a real AudioWorkletProcessor, in a real
        headless Chromium (Playwright), to decide which zone/variation/
        pitch-offset/gain should play;
     2. kotoba-lang/audio's REAL audio.synth oscillator + ADSR envelope,
        also inside that same worklet, to actually render it;
     3. captures the real rendered PCM via OfflineAudioContext.

   Then, right here (no browser involved), it:
     a. requires kami.ongaku.e2e.fixture directly (the SAME .cljc source the
        browser bundle was compiled from) and recomputes the trigger
        decision offline, to cross-verify the browser's decision
        bit-for-bit;
     b. requires kotoba-lang/audio's audio.synth directly and recomputes the
        full expected waveform, to diff against the captured PCM;
     c. actually MEASURES the frequency present in the captured PCM (via
        interpolated zero-crossing timing over the steady-state envelope
        window) -- not merely asserting the decision was followed, but
        checking what the rendered audio really contains.

   Requires: `bash scripts/build-e2e-bundles.sh` run first, `npm install`
   inside test/e2e/ for the Playwright dependency, and this repo's own src/
   plus a checkout of kotoba-lang/audio on the nbb classpath:
