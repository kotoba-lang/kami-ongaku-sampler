(ns kami.ongaku.sampler.e2e.main-driver
  "E2E-only, main-thread bundle for kami-ongaku-sampler's real-browser
   AudioWorkletProcessor trigger proof. Uses org-w3-webaudio's own
   src/w3/webaudio.cljs binding layer (not raw AudioContext calls) --
   reusing its proven OfflineAudioContext + audioWorklet.addModule +
   AudioWorkletNode recipe rather than reinventing it -- to run one fresh
   OfflineAudioContext render PER (note, velocity, trigger-count) input
   (OfflineAudioContext.startRendering() can only be called once per
   context, so a sequence of trigger inputs means a sequence of contexts,
   not one context reused).

   For each input: creates the context, loads the worklet DSP bundle
   (test/e2e/page/worklet-processor.js), creates the AudioWorkletNode,
   listens on node.port for the {decision: ...} message the worklet posts
   back (the worklet's process() return value only controls audio output,
   not arbitrary data -- the decision has to cross the MessagePort, which is
   exactly why org-w3-webaudio's binding layer exposes port/on-message!),
   renders, and captures the actual PCM. Returns an array of
   {input, decision, pcm, sampleRate} for test/e2e/run_e2e.cljs (nbb) to
   cross-check against its own, independently-computed offline decision +
   measured frequency.

   Compiled the same way as worklet_dsp.cljs (:optimizations advanced +
   self-polyfill.js) for consistency -- see that namespace's docstring.

   IMPORTANT (found empirically here, not previously documented by
   org-w3-webaudio, whose own E2E never reads an app-level property off an
   incoming postMessage payload): reading a property off a value that
   crossed INTO this compilation unit from outside (a MessagePort message,
   here) must use bracket/string-keyed access (`aget`), NOT dot-interop
   (`.-foo`/`..`). `worklet_dsp.cljs` and this namespace are compiled by
   TWO SEPARATE `cljs.main -c` invocations (two independent Closure
   compilations, each with its OWN property-renaming map). An object
   literal returned from an `^:export`-ed function is left with its
   property names intact (Closure knows it 'escapes' the compilation unit),
   which is why worklet_dsp's `#js {:decision ...}` correctly still says
   `decision:` in the compiled bundle -- but a plain dot-access read of an
   *incoming* value of unknown/native shape (`ev.data.decision`, where
   `ev.data` is a generically-externed `MessageEvent.data`) is NOT treated
   as escaping, and Closure's ordinary internal property-renaming pass DOES
   rename it (empirically: `.decision` was renamed to `.bc` in one build
   here) -- to a name that has nothing to do with the ACTUAL property name
   the other, independently-compiled bundle produced. Symptom: `.-decision`
   silently reads `undefined` (a data race, decision was actually there in
   the runtime object) despite the underlying render/PCM data being
   perfectly correct. Fix applied below: `(aget (.-data ev) \"decision\")`
   -- bracket access with a string literal is never renamed by Closure,
   because it can't statically know the key at rename time."

  ;; The worklet posts its {decision: ...} message over the MessagePort
  ;; during the AudioWorkletProcessor's constructor (before rendering even
  ;; starts), but cross-thread postMessage delivery to the main thread is
  ;; still a genuinely separate, asynchronously-scheduled task -- it is NOT
  ;; guaranteed to have already run by the time OfflineAudioContext's
  ;; startRendering() promise resolves (verified empirically: reading an
  ;; atom snapshotted only in the startRendering().then callback raced and
  ;; lost the message on every single input in first-pass testing here).
  ;; Fix: build a genuine decision-promise (resolved from the port's
  ;; onmessage handler) and Promise.all it together with the render
  ;; promise, rather than assuming message delivery precedes render
  ;; completion.
